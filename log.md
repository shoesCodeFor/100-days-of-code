## 100 Days of Code: Round 2
### Day 3: June 15th 
**Today's Progress**

**Thoughts**

### Day 3: June 15th 
**Today's Progress**  Minimal progress today.  I worked a little bit on my Angular 4 Sales App. 45 Mins on QBOtoWoo.  

**Thoughts:**  Going to have to make a lot of progress to hit my deadline tomorrow.  As I am writing down my thought for the 70th time I realize I should make a php post for this log file to make it easier :)  

### Day 2: June 14th
**Today's Progress:**  Got Composer to build the WooWrapper properly.  Now I am grabbing what attributes that I think I will need for an inventory sync(Price, Quantity on Hand, Backorder, SKU, ID).  

**Thoughts:** Yesterday was frustrating.  Today was much better.  I got a lot of my components for the WooCommerce working.  I would like to have this done by Friday.(2 more days).  I was also thinking that I can keep the WooCommerce module separate for using it to model data for some other front-end like Angular or React.

### Day 1: June 13th
**Today's Progress:**  Started a new utility project.  QBOtoWoo is a tool I would like to create to help people sync their WooCommerce product inventory with Quickbooks Online.  Not very much progress today.  Had issues getting Composer to install on my dev environment.  I spent more time reading Composer docs than anything else today.

**Thoughts:** I have issues with using the same environment for every project.  I think I need to limit the amount of languages I am trying to code in.  My brain feels a little scrambled with Composer after trying to learn NPM this week.

### Day 0: June 12th
**Today's Progress:** Some updates on the first UI view of VetCalc.  Cleaned up some code for the ERMedsActivity.

**Thoughts:** I have been coding everyday but not within the rules of the challenge.  Here we go again(and hopefully again and again).
Need to change my package names.  I will have to read on how to do this without blowing up the program.  Good thing we have version control :) 



## Failed Attempt 1 January 13th - February 17th 2017
I will have to restart the challenge.  I got sucked into a work project and I have spent alot of time using tools to implement code rather than writing it :( RIP Session 1

I should also note I am coding every day, but not within the specs of the challenge(meaning not an hour for leisure).  


### Day 0: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Mixed success.  'buildButton.js' is working.  It creates button elements for Bootstrap with a glyphicon. I thought this would take me less than an hour but I got hung up on some of the built in JS methods.  Seems like it is functional enough for today.  Future improvements would be including an input string for an 'onclick()' event.

**Thoughts**:  I am going to try and work on things that are related to my progress in FreeCodeCamp. Some of the excercises for Bootstrap are for Buttons with Glyphicons.  Today I wanted to try to build a JS function that will create this button with text and icon.  The workflow will go something like, 4 Strings will be passed to the function (Target selector, New Button Name, GlyphIcon and Button Text).  This is probably not useful for anything other than practicing some JavaScript chops.

### Day 1: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started out trying to make a JavaScript driven background generator that changes the background according to the time of day.  SO far all I have is a JS clock.  I still need to create logic to change css classes according to the users time of day.

**Thoughts**:  I got kind of lost trying to incorperate a method to determine the users Sunrise/Sunset from an API.  Not neccessary to complete the project but probably useful for another project.  I have a method to get JSON data of local city and sunrise/sunset from Wunderground but exceeded my calls.

### Day 2: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have a working demo now :)  The function selects one of six css classes based on the time of day and swaps them within the '.timeBackground' class.  

**Thoughts**:  I learned a new way of passing optional arguments through ES6 <a href="http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues">http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues</a> and it made me think that I should focus my energies on learning Angular 2 and ES6 rather than older JS tutorials.  Moving forward it would be neat to create a page that will generate code with custom colors and times that will produce custom CSS/JS.

### Day 3: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I went to a hackathon for CodeForDenver.  I wasn't much help to the teams but learned so much.  I also worked on my tour-of-heroes Angular App to integrate it into another project I am working on.

**Thoughts**:  Somedays I feel like I am truly starting from scratch.  Some of the advanced web apps I saw tonight makes me realize I need to pick up the pace on my learning speed.

** No link to work tonight.  I will push the Angular app once I can get it to tanspile correctly. **

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Day 4: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I broke the timeBuilder plugin out of frustration.  So I think that is the opposite of what goes here.  The #100DaysOfCode bot told me that, "Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another."  I hope a person told them to say that because it's good!

**Thoughts**:  Forge ahead.

### Day 5: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an old project.  It's a basic pixel painter I learned in an Intro to JS.  I added some viewport stuff and randomColor generator.  

**Thoughts**:  I need to keep a better log.

### Day 6: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed time builder background.  I am trying to make a demo so that you can view changes in real time.  

**Thoughts**:  I need to setup a user page on Github pages so that it will generate a zip with CSS code.

### Day 7: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a search tool for Blairs FFL Scoreboard.  I would like to use some kind of autocomplete to suggest player names out of the json file that is being searched.  More on that tomorrow.  Also would like to start making all of the pieces fit into a single page style app.

**Thoughts**:  Better do a little digging on some jQuery autocomplete for tomorrow.
We lost a push somewhere.  :( FML

### Day 8: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the search tools for the FFL scoreboard.  Not too much progress.  Lots of code cleanup.  Autocomplete is a little far out right now.  The array has 16k entries and so I think its breaking.

**Thoughts**:  I got my wisdom teeth out two days ago and it has thrown my logging and coding into disarray.  WTF.

### Day 9: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the JS30.  Learned a new binding trick for ES5.  Still need to style the kit page but sounds are working.  Pretty Sweet.

**Thoughts**:  I should have used Wes's CSS but I think making my own will be more fun.

### Day 10: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on day 2 of JS30 and learned that using const for element control is common amongst the pros.

**Thoughts**:  I need to relax sometimes.  My frustration allows me to miss very obvious and simple mistakes.

### Day 11: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on day 3 of JS30 and learned a lot about CSS vars.  I did not know you could change them in JS.  This is exciting.

**Thoughts**:  Baby steps I guess.  Lot of HW going on :(

### Day 12: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Blairs FFL Scoreboard. Made some functions to receive our JSON team objects.

**Thoughts**: Just trying to wrap my head around some basic python stuff like the difference between arrays and lists.

### Day 13: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Array cardio for the JS30 Day 4.
Filter, Map, Sort, Reduce and repeat.  Pretty useful for sure. I see this skill requirement on ever JS front end job around.  I can understand why.

**Thought's**: console.table() is the best thing I learned all day. 

https://shoescodefor.github.io/tutorials/JS/ArrayCardio/index.html


### Day 14: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Functions in Python - I'm not really good with Python so I'm forcing some exposure.  Today I worked on parsing JSON objects and passing them into a function.  

**Thought's**: So far so good.  It seems like Python has so many libraries that it might be the most universally appliable language.  I should learn more.

Progress:

### Day 15: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another night at code fights.  I did a challenge with array matching. 

**Thought's**: I lost again in this battle but I like this style of practicing more than doing tutorials.  It seems more fun

### Day 16: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Trying to fix the searchPlayer.html page in our FFL project.  I can search by first name or last name but not both in conjunction. 

**Thought's**: I need to figure out a better way to create these lists for the autocomplete.

https://github.com/shoesCodeFor/BlairsFFL_Dashboard/tree/master/Pi/Web_Interface/searchPlayer.html

### Day 17: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More attempts at code fights.  I keep losing but it is making me realize that I am not as far along as I want to be.  I have partially finished all of the challenges in my battle.  Better than last time.

**Thought's**: I have to work harder on the coding side of things.  I am exhausted from school, but I know if I want a development job straight out of school I will have to up my game.  


### Day 18: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A crash course on Magento e-commerce.   This is not really programming per se.  Mostly just read documentation on their API.  Magento 2 seems like a legitimate product.  

**Thought's**: I am still trying to appreciate why Magento is so popular.  Maybe it is a better solution at scale.  I have procduced similar solutions with less complications with WordPress + WooCommerce.

### Day 19: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some HTTP get requests on the NFL Fantasy API.  Got some pretty amazing results on player lists.  I will try and use this for the FFL project.

**Thought's**: We've been using the BurntSushi/nflgame Python module for this project.  I much better programmer than myself suggested that this was not good practice because we are relying on a non-official party to provide data.


### Day 20: February 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Some tinkering with the Quickbooks API.  I decided to go this route instead of Magento.  I am confident that I can build a basic sync tool for QBO and PHP e-commerce stores. 

**Thought's**: This is gonna get ugly.  Note:  I tinkered with this a little more and got some pretty descent requests from their sandbox company.  It's pretty far fetched now but I think it would be worth the invested time to build a basic web app that integrates with WooCommerce and QBO.  

### Day 21: February 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Tried to clean up an old class project.  I did all the coding on this web app but it is still very unfinished. I tried to make some tables fill in for current schedules.

**Thought's**: It would be nice to scrape some data from the school to pull into our database so I have more data to look at.  I also need to build a dummy login so people can demo the site.

### Day 22: February 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on nodeMCU.  I had some issues getting the board to program.  Used an arduino to flash the new nodeMCU firmware.  

**Thoughts**:  THe knockoff microcontrollers are not worth the money.  Adafruit makes a better version of this for $15 but I bought 3 of the nodeMCUs for the same price.  It's hard to argue with those economics.  As I release FloraSync builds on a larger scale I will suggest Adafruit's stuff because it will be less work on the users. 

### Day 23: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Android App programming.  Mixed results.  I created an additional view for my Bio page and it broke the app. Something to do with using the default layout as a template and the views go on top of the default.  

**Thought's**:  I think I misunderstood the concept of the MVC in Android. Fixing

No Link today.  I'll push when I get the build to work.

### Day 24: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fetch with Wes Bos on the JS30 track.  I haven't done one of these projects in a while.

**Thought's**: Fetch is pretty neat.  I am still having issues applying any of this to the FFL project.  


### Day 25: February 7, 2017
**Today's Progress**:  None really.  I spent 2 hours trying to rework my search player tool with the fetch function I learned yesterday.  
**Thought's**: I think the structure of my JSON is throing me off.  I need to drill down to layers into the object before extracting the elements within.  In java this would be easy by calling the 3d array <code>arrayName[0][get these ones]  Looks like I need to read more on JS parsing.</code>

### Day 26: February 8, 2017
**Today's Progress**:  More on the node MCU.  I learned about what analogWrite really does in Arduino.  Tried to figure out why my sensor would not work.  

**Thought's**: 

### Day 27: February 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**:  I was wrong about my methods yesterday.  Today they worked like a charm.  I used the analogWrite function (which enable pulse width modulation on arduino) to limit the amount of voltage going to my sensor and in turn limiting the voltage to the Analog pin on the nodeMCU (its limit is 1 volt).

**Thought's**: Figured out my issue yesterday was a bad lead on my board.  SOLDER EVERYTHING!!!  Moving forward I will try and make this more precise and add some kind of protection for the sensor.  


### Day 28: February 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**:  Today I worked on getting some data from a live server to the node.  There is an amazing library and I was able to get some dummy data from my server and parse it into a C++ object. (that sounds weird)

**Thought's Progress**:  Really excited about the progress today.  These mcu's are ideal for my project.  Before I was trying to integrate an RF24 radio and had lots of issues with connectivity.  Also I truly feel like all software is built on the backs of giants. THe library I used today is built out of the love of coding.  Pretty awesome.

Need to push all my node work

### Day 29: February 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**:  Started some practice problems at CodinGame.com.  I was getting frustrated with being terrible at CodeFights.  Today I did one excercise and it took about an hour and a half.

**Thoughts:  The structure of these challenges is ideal for me.  I noticed today that a little noticable progress like the leveling up in the games helps keep me going.  I am swamped with school right now and it is hard to code for 'leisure' for an hour a day.

### Day 30: February 12th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: More at CodinGame.  Solved one problem but it took me forever.  I switched from JS to Java for my final solution.

**Thoughts**:  There is more than one way to skin a cat and who ever came up with that expression is sick in the head.  I will try and solve the second problem I started today tomorrow.  

### Day 30: February 13th, 2017
**Today's progress**:  It was painful today.  I spent 3 hours on the Chuck Norris Problem and I couldn't get anything to work.  

**Thoughts**:  Maybe I need to scrap everything.  Sometimes that scares me after 3 plus hours coding on something.  

### Day 31: February 14th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Started on some PHP for a project I had over the summer.  I am using the PHP 7 Docs to build classes for an API.  I built one small class for another part of the project.  Also spent some time on Codingame again.

**Thoughts**: I finally understand the idea of abstraction or at least why it is good in principle.  My thoughts on security were always that if someone wanted to hack your site(as a freelance dev) they would find you CPanel login and dump your DB tables.  I am finally realizing on scalable apps and enterprise level development they have security teams that protect that side of Info Systems.  As an engineer you are supposed to ensure there are no holes in your work.   

I don't mean to sound arrogant in the last part.  It is really quite the opposite.  I have never appreciated how difficult it is to implement good security and authentication and now most frameworks obscure passwords so a hack would have to use the apps own tech to extract data in a modern attack. 

### Day 32: February 15th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I tried to get a Laravel blog going.  I got the page installed and created some changes on the Welcome view, but then I could not get the app to change routes.  

**Thoughts** I think something in Wordpress's .htaccess file prevents the routes from going through properly.  It will forward from the default page to my welcome view but when go to a route directly it 404s from my Wordpress install 2 folders it parent.  Throughly confused.  I'll try this again on a fresh server next time(probably a Pi).

## Day 33:  February 16th, 2017
**Today's Progress** I completed a couple easy puzzles on CodeFights.com.  

**Thoughts**  I should really stick to less than 3 languages.  I think I get a little lost in all the syntax.  I know that there are equivalents in almost all languages know.  I wasted 45 minuted and had 20+ lines of code trying to solve a problem today.  Eventually I solved the same problem with 5 lines of Java.  JavaScript totally screws with my brain and its loose data types.  I had a test yesterday on Oracle PL/SQL for my Advanced Database Managment class and wrote <code>DBMS_OUTPUT.println()</code>
in my program.  My brain shorted out and made some weird PLSQL/JAVA hybrid.  He didn't notice but I did. :( 

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 34: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Awesome day in my project world.  Mixed day in the professional one.  I successfully implemented Clef.io into my PHP app.  Pretty pumped.  At work I had some more headaches with Quickbook and Intuit's software in general. 

**Thought's**: For some reason it is a huge load off now FloraSync has a descent authentication method.  I don't actually want to keep any data for FloraSync.  I think the optionally loaded user data will be the most useful.
