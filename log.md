# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Mixed success.  'buildButton.js' is working.  It creates button elements for Bootstrap with a glyphicon. I thought this would take me less than an hour but I got hung up on some of the built in JS methods.  Seems like it is functional enough for today.  Future improvements would be including an input string for an 'onclick()' event.

**Thoughts**:  I am going to try and work on things that are related to my progress in FreeCodeCamp. Some of the excercises for Bootstrap are for Buttons with Glyphicons.  Today I wanted to try to build a JS function that will create this button with text and icon.  The workflow will go something like, 4 Strings will be passed to the function (Target selector, New Button Name, GlyphIcon and Button Text).  This is probably not useful for anything other than practicing some JavaScript chops.

### Day 1: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started out trying to make a JavaScript driven background generator that changes the background according to the time of day.  SO far all I have is a JS clock.  I still need to create logic to change css classes according to the users time of day.

**Thoughts**:  I got kind of lost trying to incorperate a method to determine the users Sunrise/Sunset from an API.  Not neccessary to complete the project but probably useful for another project.  I have a method to get JSON data of local city and sunrise/sunset from Wunderground but exceeded my calls.
