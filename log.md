# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Mixed success.  'buildButton.js' is working.  It creates button elements for Bootstrap with a glyphicon. I thought this would take me less than an hour but I got hung up on some of the built in JS methods.  Seems like it is functional enough for today.  Future improvements would be including an input string for an 'onclick()' event.

**Thoughts**:  I am going to try and work on things that are related to my progress in FreeCodeCamp. Some of the excercises for Bootstrap are for Buttons with Glyphicons.  Today I wanted to try to build a JS function that will create this button with text and icon.  The workflow will go something like, 4 Strings will be passed to the function (Target selector, New Button Name, GlyphIcon and Button Text).  This is probably not useful for anything other than practicing some JavaScript chops.

### Day 1: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started out trying to make a JavaScript driven background generator that changes the background according to the time of day.  SO far all I have is a JS clock.  I still need to create logic to change css classes according to the users time of day.

**Thoughts**:  I got kind of lost trying to incorperate a method to determine the users Sunrise/Sunset from an API.  Not neccessary to complete the project but probably useful for another project.  I have a method to get JSON data of local city and sunrise/sunset from Wunderground but exceeded my calls.

### Day 2: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I have a working demo now :)  The function selects one of six css classes based on the time of day and swaps them within the '.timeBackground' class.  

**Thoughts**:  I learned a new way of passing optional arguments through ES6 <a href="http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues">http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues</a> and it made me think that I should focus my energies on learning Angular 2 and ES6 rather than older JS tutorials.  Moving forward it would be neat to create a page that will generate code with custom colors and times that will produce custom CSS/JS.

### Day 3: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I went to a hackathon for CodeForDenver.  I wasn't much help to the teams but learned so much.  I also worked on my tour-of-heroes Angular App to integrate it into another project I am working on.

**Thoughts**:  Somedays I feel like I am truly starting from scratch.  Some of the advanced web apps I saw tonight makes me realize I need to pick up the pace on my learning speed.

** No link to work tonight.  I will push the Angular app once I can get it to tanspile correctly. **

### Day 4: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I broke the timeBuilder plugin out of frustration.  So I think that is the opposite of what goes here.  The #100DaysOfCode bot told me that, "Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another."  I hope a person told them to say that because it's good!

**Thoughts**:  Forge ahead.

### Day 5: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an old project.  It's a basic pixel painter I learned in an Intro to JS.  I added some viewport stuff and randomColor generator.  

**Thoughts**:  I need to keep a better log.

### Day 6: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed time builder background.  I am trying to make a demo so that you can view changes in real time.  

**Thoughts**:  I need to setup a user page on Github pages so that it will generate a zip with CSS code.

### Day 7: January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a search tool for Blairs FFL Scoreboard.  I would like to use some kind of autocomplete to suggest player names out of the json file that is being searched.  More on that tomorrow.  Also would like to start making all of the pieces fit into a single page style app.

**Thoughts**:  Better do a little digging on some jQuery autocomplete for tomorrow.
We lost a push somewhere.  :( FML

### Day 8: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the search tools for the FFL scoreboard.  Not too much progress.  Lots of code cleanup.  Autocomplete is a little far out right now.  The array has 16k entries and so I think its breaking.

**Thoughts**:  I got my wisdom teeth out two days ago and it has thrown my logging and coding into disarray.  WTF.

### Day 9: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the JS30.  Learned a new binding trick for ES5.  Still need to style the kit page but sounds are working.  Pretty Sweet.

**Thoughts**:  I should have used Wes's CSS but I think making my own will be more fun.

### Day 10: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on day 2 of JS30 and learned that using const for element control is common amongst the pros.

**Thoughts**:  I need to relax sometimes.  My frustration allows me to miss very obvious and simple mistakes.

### Day 11: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on day 3 of JS30 and learned a lot about CSS vars.  I did not know you could change them in JS.  This is exciting.

**Thoughts**:  Baby steps I guess.  Lot of HW going on :(

### Day 12: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Blairs FFL Scoreboard. Made some functions to receive our JSON team objects.

**Thoughts**: Just trying to wrap my head around some basic python stuff like the difference between arrays and lists.

### Day 13: January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Array cardio for the JS30 Day 4.
Filter, Map, Sort, Reduce and repeat.  Pretty useful for sure. I see this skill requirement on ever JS front end job around.  I can understand why.

**Thought's**: console.table() is the best thing I learned all day.
